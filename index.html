            I am a creative person who loves to listen to
            music and among my passions there are SONG and
            ACTING. <br> I have loved acting since I was a child, i like computer enginearing and <strong>CODING</strong><br> but i thougt it i was not 
            good at mathematics not untill i found powercoders which brought out the meaning to coding in me  
            I love to help those in need. <br>
            I don't like to talk too much but i like lifestyle
            rough games. <br>
            I love R&B, afrobeat and classic songs.

            TO ACT 
        </h2>
        <p>
            Acting is something that brings out the
            expression
            and feelings in your body.
            <br> It brings us to reality of life.
            It makes us think we can do anything either
            go through any situation.</p></div>
